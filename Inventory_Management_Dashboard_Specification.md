# Inventory Management Dashboard for a Small Business

## Overview

The goal is to develop an Inventory Management Dashboard for a small business to monitor and manage product stock across multiple store locations. This React application will enable the business owner to view stock levels, add new products, update inventory, and oversee stock distribution in a user-friendly interface.

## Functional Requirements

### Redux State Management

- Implement Redux for global state management, handling actions such as fetching, adding, and updating inventory data.
- Use Redux thunk middleware for asynchronous API calls.

#### Sample Redux State Structure

```json
{
  "inventory": {
    "products": [],
    "loading": false,
    "error": null
  },
  "filters": {
    "searchQuery": ""
  }
}
```

### Dashboard View

- Display an overview of total inventory, low-stock items, and recently added products.
- Use Redux selectors to access and derive state data for the dashboard.

### Product Listing

- Present a detailed list of products, including name, price, quantity, and location.
- Access global product data from the Redux store.

#### Sample Product JSON Structure

```json
{
  "id": "unique-product-id",
  "name": "Product Name",
  "price": 19.99,
  "quantity": 100,
  "location": "Store Location"
}
```

#### Validation Constraints for Products

- Name: Required, string, max 100 characters.
- Price: Required, number, min 0.01.
- Quantity: Required, integer, min 1.
- Location: Required, string, max 50 characters.

### Stock Update Feature

- A form interface to adjust stock levels for each product.
- Dispatch Redux actions for stock updates, with optimistic UI updates.

### Routing

- Use React Router for app navigation between Dashboard, Product Listing, and Stock Update pages.
- Implement dynamic routing for individual product detail pages.

### Add New Product

- A form to input new inventory items, with fields for name, price, initial quantity, and location.
- Use Redux actions to update the product list upon form submission.

### Search Functionality

- A search bar to filter products by name or location.
- Implement search logic within Redux thunks.

### API Integration and Data Persistence

- Integrate API calls within Redux actions to fetch and update data from a backend server.
- Use `useEffect` to dispatch Redux actions for initial data load and synchronize state with the backend.

#### API Endpoints

- GET `/api/inventory`: Fetch inventory data.
- POST `/api/inventory`: Add a new product.
- PUT `/api/inventory/{productId}`: Update existing product data.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Responsive Design

- The application must be responsive and functional on various devices and screen sizes.

### Error Handling

- Implement error handling for API interactions within Redux.

### Performance Optimization

- Optimize state updates and component re-renders for smooth UI interactions.

## Suggestions for Expansion

- Integrate real backend service for data persistence instead of mock API.
- Implement user authentication and authorization for different access levels.
- Incorporate predictive analytics for inventory forecasting.
- Connect application with real-time sales data for automated inventory management.
